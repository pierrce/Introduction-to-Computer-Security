# Part A:

## Recovered password

## Pseudocode for attack

## Worst case running time

## Discussion of current proposal and suggestions for improvement


# Part B:

## Discussion of the current scheme
this is using AEC using CBC mode for encryption, the badencrypt.py allows for inversions of message blocks and they are
using Encrypt-and-Mac for their authentication scheme which is not secure if the attacker can change the M, he can
change the hash.

## Suggestions for improving the scheme
sue GCM instead of CBC and use encrypt-then-mac for the authentication scheme
