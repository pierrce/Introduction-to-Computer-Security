# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.

Traceroute is a tool that provides the user with a list of the name/IP addresse pairs of the internet network nodes 
from the calling computer and a designated destination address passed by opperand. 
Traceroute works by sending UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets with assending TTL(Time to Live) 
values starting with the value 1. At each network node the UDP packet's TTL is decreased by one and once the TTL hits 
0 the gateway returns a ICMP "time exceeded" reply. Tracetoute displays the number of hops(initial TTL value for that packet) 
and the address of the gateway in order. This results in a trace the path from the sender to the eventual destination. 
Traceroute dose this standard 30 times or until the destination is reached. The destination is reached when the calling system gets a 
ICMP "port unreachable" reply. We get this "port unreachable" reply because Traceroute uses a unlikly to be used port, this works
provided the deitination server admin is not a clod and uses the port that traceroute uses normally. The port can be changed 
using the -p flag.
